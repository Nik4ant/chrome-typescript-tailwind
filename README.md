# TODO:
1. Create readme with useful info and info for idiots
2. Post article about this thingy on medium and other websites?
3. Add optimizations for prod build (html compression?, images compression)

# Static restructure
You can restructure this folder however you want.
For example, you might want to do this:
```
- Static
    - Assets
        - img
        ...
    ...
``` 
Over this:
```
- Static
    - Icons
    ...
```
The max you'll have to do is to change a few lines inside webpack config
